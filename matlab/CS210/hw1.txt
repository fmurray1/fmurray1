1. select * from emp;





to select all employeees hired after jan 01 1982

select * from emp where hiredate > '1982-01-01';


to only show the names

select ename from emp where hiredate > '1982-01-01';

joining tables

for each row in table 2 it adds each of them to each row in table 1

so if table 1 has 3 rows and table 2 has 2 rows

the resulting joined table will have 6 rows



this is the proper way to do it

select ename, job, dname from emp join dept using(deptno);


empno == mgr doesnt work








2. select ename, sal from emp join dept using(deptno) where job = 'MANAGER';





3. select ename, sal from emp order by sal desc;


4. select ename, dname from emp join dept using(deptno);



5. come back to


6. select ename, sal from emp where sal >= 1500 and sal < 3000;


7. select ename, job, sal from emp join dept using(deptno) where loc = 'NEW YORK';

8. select ename, job, sal from emp join dept using(deptno) where loc = "CHICAGO' or sal < 2000;

9. select ename, job, sal from emp join dept using(deptno) where loc = "CHICAGO' and sal < 2000; 

10. select ename, job, sal from emp join dept using(deptno) where loc = "CHICAGO' and sal >= 2000;
